Calvario is a VCV Rack plugin performing cross-modulation through a XOR function. So silly it seems unreal.
It can be used as frequency mixer, distortion, waveshaper, frequency modulator, hard syncer, swarm detuner and more.


## Release
Currently released for Windows only, for VCV Rack 2.
Install the plugin extracting it from the zip and copying it into your VCV rack plugins folder (usually in Appdata/Local/Rack2)
