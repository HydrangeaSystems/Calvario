![LOVJ logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/merumerutho/Calvario/main/logo/Calvario.png)

Calvario is a VCV Rack plugin performing XOR cross-modulation. So silly yet so powerful.

With its rich harmonic generation it can be used as a distortion, waveshaper, frequency modulator, hard syncer, "swarm" detuner and more.

The plugin boasts CV controls at the input and output to regulate the intensity of the effect, and the dry/wet mix on the output.
A soft/hard effect mode button is also included to boost the distortion/waveshaping effect.

## Release
Currently released for Windows only, for VCV Rack 2.

Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/merumerutho/Calvario/releases/).
